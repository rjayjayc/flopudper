floppy-Udp-Server
=================

I made a program that reads floppy commands and I have that already finished. Now I want to implement it in a udp server/client environment. so basically my client would connect to my server. The my server would check to make sure that it services one client at a time. Once it checks that then it reply back to the client asking for my floppy commands. The server would then process it and output it to client
